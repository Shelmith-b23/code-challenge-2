# Learning Goals
Build a functioning guest list application

Suppress a default action with event.preventDefault()

Introduction
In this code challenge, you'll be creating a simple Event Guest List Manager that uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

You’ll practice working with forms, capturing user input, and updating the page dynamically using JavaScript — all without refreshing the browser.

Code Challenge: Build an Event Guest List Manager
Instead of relying on tests, this code challenge is deliverable-driven. You will be responsible for ensuring that your solution works as intended by testing the behavior in the browser.

Structuring Your Code
You will structure your code just like:

index.html: your HTML layout

src/index.js: your JavaScript logic

style.css: your styling

# Deliverables
As a user:

I should be able to type a guest's name into the input field.

I should be able to click a submit button to add the guest.

I should see the guest's name appear in a list on the page after I submit the form.

I should be able to remove a guest from the list using a delete button.

Add a "Remove" button for each guest

Limit the guest list to 10 people — alert the user if they exceed the limit
Add a "Toggle RSVP" feature — guests can be marked as “Attending” or “Not Attending”
Your final app does not have to look like a specific demo. Be creative! Your design and layout are up to you, as long as the functionality works.

# Stretch Deliverables
After completing the required functionality, challenge yourself with these extra features:

Allow guests to be categorized as Friend, Family, or Colleague, with color tags

Display the time when each guest was added

Add an Edit button that allows updating a guest's name

Your own custom feature

# Testing
You are responsible for manually testing your app in the browser. Use console.log() while you build, and reload the page frequently to see your updates.
